t.test(a_training, b_training, paired=TRUE)
### We see p-value>0.05, therefore no change in blood pressure in XYZ.
#Blood pressure to ABC drug
a_training = c(155,	142,	145,	160,	149,	152,	157,	159,	166,	163,	158,	161)
b_training = c(150,	135,	142,	153,	142,	147,	152,	149,	158,	155,	150,	150)
t.test(a_training, b_training, paired=TRUE, alt="less") 
### We reject null hypo, and accept that there is change in blood pressure using drug ABC.
### Conclusion: We notice that there is greater changes in means of blood pressure of the 12 patients using drug ABC. Drug XYZ has less effect on the patients blood pressure.
